# Face-Recognition-using-Eigenfaces

This is an implementation of Face Detection and real-time Face Recognition using Eigenfaces. It is based on the paper on face recognition using PCA
algorithm by M. Turk and A. Pentland.

## How To:
To run the face recognition on the AT&T dataset:
> python Face_Recognition_AT&T_dataset.py

To run face recognition using webcam :
> python Face_Recognition_real_time.py

## Libraries used:
- opencv
- pandas
- numpy
- fnmatch
- os
- sys


## Face Recognition using AT&T dataset :
#### Dataset Used : AT&T face dataset
The Face Recognition model has two parts : Train and Test

## Results :
Face Detection: The results is an output that shows in which class each test image
belongs.

Face Recognition: Capable of recognising faces in realtime using the webcam.
